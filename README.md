# Credit-Risk-Modelling

## Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a borrower's failure to make payments on their debt obligations. It is typically associated with lending money to individuals or businesses, but can also apply to other forms of credit such as bonds.

Credit risk modeling is important in the banking industry because it helps banks predict the likelihood of default for a borrower, allowing them to make informed lending decisions and set appropriate interest rates. Additionally, it also helps banks to monitor and manage their overall credit exposure, which is essential for maintaining the stability and profitability of the institution.

## This Project
In this project, I eveluated different classification algorithms CART, C5.0, Random Forest, and kNN to find out the best performance. To evaluate this model, I evaluated the accuracy of the algorithms with Confusion Matrix, MSE, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the ROC curve).

This dataset has 6 variables in which the variable "risk" is the target variable along with 5 predictors, *mortgage*, *number of loans*, *age*, *marital status*, and *income*. In the target variable, customers are classified as either “*good risk*” or “*bad risk*”. 

## Summary
To classify whether a new customer is a good risk or bad risk, the best performed algorithm was Random Forest in this project.
